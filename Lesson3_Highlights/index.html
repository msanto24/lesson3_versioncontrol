            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a type of system that will record all of the different changes made to a file or set of files over an extended period of time. The idea behind version control is that an individual will then be able to recall the file from any point in time in its life. It periodically saves versions of the same file as it is progressively worked on. This is ideal for projects that are being worked on by more than one individual. It allows people to be able and see what has been added, who added it, and if they desire they can go to a version prior to the changes. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized version control systems were the solution to the problem of people having to collaborate with developers working on different systems. CVCS designed a centralized server with every version of a file in existence. This single database makes it easier for all of the clients looking to check on the file because it’s located in a single place. The up-sides of a centralized control system are the ability to control and administer who can access the files. The biggest concern with CVCS is the fact that if the single server were to go down, nobody would have access to the files they need to work on. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The main problem associated with the idea of a centralized version control system is that it is possible for the central server to some how become corrupted in which everything could be lost. With distributed version control systems, clients are able to mirror the repository they are working in and the full version history of its files. So if you were collaborating with a server that happened to die or become corrupt, you could back up the entire repository and have an exact clone of the data. This is the most important version control system for us to understand because it is the type we will be using in this course. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is GIT?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is an open access and free of charge distributed version control system. GIT differs from other version control systems in the way it analyzes data. Other systems view the information being stored into the system as files with the changes that have been made to them over time. GIT however, stores data in an alternative way; GIT likes to compare the way it stores data to a series of snapshots. When you save the project you’re working on, the system will take a picture of how the file looks at that point in time and stores it in the system database. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Three States</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using GIT, there are three different states your file will be in: committed, modified, and staged. When your file is committed this means that all the date along with it has been properly and safely saved to the local database. When your file is in the modified state it means that you have altered the composition of the file, but have not yet committed it back to the database. When your files are in the staged state, you have chosen a file that has had changes made to it that you want to send to your next commit snapshot. These three main states of our data are important to understand because we are going to be working with this system all throughout the semester. </p>
