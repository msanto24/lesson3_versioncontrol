## Student Name:  
(Michael Santomaso)

## Project Description:
(In this project we registered with GIThub and learned how version control systems work. URL: https://msanto24.github.io/lesson3_versioncontrol/)

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned how centralized version control systems rely on a singular server that stores the information from various clients.)
2. (I learned that distributed version control systems are more effective because they don't rely on a singular server that could           potentially crash and lose all the information within it. .)
3. (I learned how to create a repository on GIThub and how to commit the information from cloud9 into it.)
